## Epic 1 Progress: Transition Setup & Milestones (Aug 30, 2025)

### Summary
- Implemented full Milestones CRUD in Project Hub and Enhanced Transition views.
- Stabilized backend milestone operations (idempotent create, safe delete, flexible update).
- Fixed Traefik 502 by scoping JWT plugin registration inside `buildServer()`.
- Improved local dev ergonomics: Auth Bypass header toggle and dynamic API base URL.
- Added CI smoke workflow to boot stack and verify health + UI content.

### Frontend Changes
- Project Hub (`frontend/src/pages/ProjectHubPage.tsx`): Add/Edit/Delete Milestones with dialog and inline edit; dates sent at midday; surfaces backend error messages.
- Enhanced Transition Detail (`frontend/src/pages/EnhancedTransitionDetailPage.tsx`): Added Milestones CRUD; fixed JSX root and overlay structure.
- Layout (`frontend/src/components/Layout.tsx`): “Auth Bypass” toggle stores `authBypass` in localStorage.
- API base (`frontend/src/services/api.ts`, `frontend/src/services/userManagementApi.ts`): auto-detect host; configurable via `VITE_*` envs.

### Backend Changes
- Milestones service (`backend-node/src/modules/milestone/milestone.service.ts`):
  - Create: idempotency guard; validates dueDate within transition timeframe.
  - Delete: deletes related audit logs then the milestone by id.
  - Update/Get: operate by milestone id (transition lookup optional for date validation).
- Transition raw routes (`transition-raw.route.ts`) and milestone routes: `pmOnly` guard supports `x-auth-bypass` or JWT `program_manager` role.
- Server bootstrap (`backend-node/src/server.ts`): moved JWT registration inside `buildServer()` to prevent startup crash.

### CI & DevOps
- `.github/workflows/ci-smoke.yml`: boots db/redis/reverse-proxy/backend/frontend, waits for Postgres and backend health, validates homepage contains “Transitions Overview”.
- Cypress upgrade to `^15`; set `CYPRESS_INSTALL_BINARY=0` in frontend Dockerfile for leaner builds.
 - Backend Dockerfile now waits for DB and pushes Prisma schema at startup to avoid transient 502/Failed-to-fetch on cold boot.

### Known Follow-ups
- Optional: enforce JWT-based ownership/role checks once Keycloak tokens are wired into the UI.
- Optional: extend milestones with assignedTo, percentComplete, and dependencies per schema.

## Epic 1 Progress: Tasks CRUD (Aug 31, 2025)

### Summary
- Implemented Tasks for Transitions end-to-end: Prisma model + Fastify routes + frontend UI.
- Supports add, list with filters/pagination (backend), inline edit, and delete.

### Backend Changes
- Prisma schema: added `Task` model with enums and relations (`Transition.tasks`, `Milestone.tasks`, `AuditLog.task`).
- Service (`backend-node/src/modules/task/task.service.ts`):
  - Create: idempotency guard (same transitionId + title + dueDate returns existing) and due date validation against Transition window; disallow past due dates.
  - Get: filtering by `status`, `priority`, plus `overdue` and `upcoming` helpers; pagination + sorting.
  - Update/Delete: operate by task id; safe delete removes related audit logs first.
- Routes (`backend-node/src/modules/task/task.route.ts`): nested under `/api/transitions/:transitionId/tasks` with `pmOnly` guard (honors `x-auth-bypass` or JWT PM role).
- Server (`backend-node/src/server.ts`): registers Task JSON schemas and mounts nested task routes.

### Frontend Changes
- API client (`frontend/src/services/api.ts`): added `Task` type and `taskApi` with create/update/delete/getAll.
- Project Hub (`frontend/src/pages/ProjectHubPage.tsx`):
  - Tasks section with Add dialog (Title, Due Date, Priority, Description), inline Edit (Title, Due, Priority, Status, Description), and Delete.
  - Sends `x-auth-bypass` header based on Auth Bypass toggle for protected routes.
- Enhanced Transition Detail (`frontend/src/pages/EnhancedTransitionDetailPage.tsx`):
  - Added Tasks section mirroring Project Hub (list, inline edit, delete) and Add Task dialog.
  - Uses the same auth bypass header and date normalization (set due at local midday) as milestones.

### Notes
- No changes to counts surfaced on Enhanced Transition for tasks yet (`_count.tasks` not displayed).
- E2E tests for Tasks pending; consider adding Cypress coverage for create/edit/delete flows.

## Epic 1 Progress: Hierarchical Tasks & Planning View (Aug 31, 2025)

### Backend
- Prisma: Task model extended with `parentTaskId` (self-relation), `orderIndex`, and optional `sequencePath`; indexes added for `(transitionId, parentTaskId, orderIndex)`.
- Services: Task create/update now accept `parentTaskId`; due-date/transition validations preserved.
- New endpoints under `/api/transitions/:transitionId/tasks`:
  - `GET /tree` returns hierarchical tasks with computed `sequence` field.
  - `PATCH /:taskId/move` supports reordering and reparenting with `{ parentTaskId?, milestoneId?, beforeTaskId?, afterTaskId?, position? }`.
- Delete compacts sibling `orderIndex` to keep sequences stable on next read.

### Frontend
- API client: `Task` type extended with `parentTaskId`, `orderIndex`, optional `sequence` and `children`. Added `taskApi.getTree` and `taskApi.move`.
- New Planning View: `TasksAndMilestonesPage.tsx` with route `/transitions/:id/tasks-milestones` and menu entry `/tasks` (transition selector + redirect).
  - Displays Unassigned Tasks and per-milestone task groups as nested lists.
  - Inline reordering controls: Up, Down, Indent (reparent to previous sibling), Outdent (to grandparent), and Add Subtask.
  - Add Task dialog supports creating root tasks or subtasks (with milestone association optional).

### Follow-ups
- Optional: add DnD for richer reordering UX; persist/display `sequencePath` if needed.
- Add Cypress tests for move/tree and creation flows; document API in README.

## Adjustments and Fixes (Aug 31, 2025)

### Task ↔ Milestone Association
- Enhanced Transition Detail and Project Hub now support selecting a Milestone when creating or editing a Task. “Unassigned” keeps the Task independent of any Milestone.
- Planning View add dialog includes a Milestone selector; when adding within a milestone group, it can be left as-is or overridden.

### Subtasks in Enhanced Detail
- Added “Add Subtask” action per Task row on `EnhancedTransitionDetailPage.tsx`; the add dialog reflects “Add Subtask” and attaches `parentTaskId` on submit.

### Backend Robustness for FK
- `task.service.ts` validates `milestoneId` existence and ensures it belongs to the same Transition before create/update, returning clear errors instead of DB FK violations.
- Frontend create flows only send `milestoneId` when provided, avoiding empty-string/null FK issues.

### Operations
- Restarted stack via `docker-compose up -d --build`. Synced DB schema with `prisma db push`. Verified backend `/api/health` and frontend via Traefik.
