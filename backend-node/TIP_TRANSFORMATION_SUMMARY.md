## Key Technical Innovations

### 1. AI-Powered Knowledge Discovery
```typescript
// Semantic search with security filtering
const searchResults = await semanticSearchEngine.search(query, user, {
  securityFilters: await getSecurityFilters(user),
  pivRestrictions: user.pivStatus !== 'FULL_PIV',
  clearanceLevel: user.clearanceLevel,
  roleBasedFiltering: true
});
```

### 2. Dynamic PIV-Based Access Control
```typescript
// Real-time access decision engine
const accessDecision = await accessControlEngine.evaluate({
  user: userProfile,
  resource: requestedResource,
  pivStatus: await pivValidator.getCurrentStatus(user),
  clearance: await clearanceService.verify(user),
  context: requestContext
});
```

### 3. Intelligent Knowledge Preservation
```typescript
// Automated transition knowledge capture
const preservationResult = await knowledgePreservationService.preserve({
  transitionId: completedTransition.id,
  extractLessonsLearned: true,
  generateEmbeddings: true,
  createTaxonomy: true,
  enableFutureDiscovery: true
});
```
