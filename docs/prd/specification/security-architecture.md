# TIP Security & User Management Enhancement Architecture

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the architectural approach for enhancing the Transition Intelligence Platform (TIP) with comprehensive security and user management functionality. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development of authentication flows, user management interfaces, and security controls while ensuring seamless integration with the existing system.

**Relationship to Existing Architecture:**
This document supplements the existing TIP architecture by defining how new security components will integrate with the current full-stack system. It provides guidance on maintaining consistency with established patterns while implementing critical security enhancements that address authentication failures, user management interface issues, and missing administrative controls.

### Existing Project Analysis

Based on my analysis of the TIP project, I've identified the following about your existing system:

**Current Project State:**
- **Primary Purpose:** AI-powered SaaS platform for government contract transitions with role-based access control
- **Current Tech Stack:** React 18 + Vite frontend, Node.js Fastify + Python FastAPI backends, PostgreSQL 16, Docker Compose
- **Architecture Style:** Microservices with Traefik reverse proxy, containerized full-stack application
- **Deployment Method:** Docker Compose with multi-service orchestration (frontend, backend-node, backend-python, db, redis, keycloak)

**Available Documentation:**
- Comprehensive README.md with 21-entity data schema documentation
- Complete project structure documentation in `/documents/` folder
- Established API patterns and coding standards
- Docker containerization and deployment procedures
- Extensive troubleshooting and technical debt documentation

**Identified Constraints:**
- Must maintain compatibility with existing 21-entity data schema
- Keycloak integration already established but requires enhancement
- Standard development testing using proper test accounts  
- Government-level security standards required for compliance
- Existing user sessions must remain valid during deployment

### Integration Guidelines

- **File Naming:** Follow existing camelCase for TypeScript files, kebab-case for component directories
- **Folder Organization:** Group related functionality in dedicated folders while maintaining existing hierarchy
- **Import/Export Patterns:** Use existing barrel export patterns and maintain consistent import organization

## 8. Infrastructure and Deployment Integration

### Existing Infrastructure

**Current Deployment:** Docker Compose multi-service orchestration with Traefik reverse proxy  
**Infrastructure Tools:** Docker, Docker Compose, Traefik for routing, existing service configuration  
**Environments:** Development with proper test accounts, production-ready containerized deployment with feature flags

### Enhancement Deployment Strategy

**Deployment Approach:** Maintain existing Docker Compose setup with enhanced service configurations and feature flag support  
**Infrastructure Changes:** No infrastructure changes required - enhancements work within current containerization  
**Pipeline Integration:** Builds on existing Docker build processes with enhanced health checks for authentication services

**Session Preservation Implementation:**
- JWT token refresh endpoint maintains user sessions during authentication system updates
- Session migration service preserves existing user login state during deployment phases
- Graceful degradation ensures users remain logged in during system transitions
- Database session store maintains continuity between old and new authentication flows

**Feature Flag Deployment Strategy:**
- Environment variable configuration: `FEATURE_FLAGS_CONFIG` with JSON flag definitions
- Database override capability for runtime flag adjustments without deployments
- User cohort assignment based on user ID hash for consistent experience
- Gradual rollout monitoring with automatic rollback triggers for authentication failures

### Rollback Strategy

**Rollback Method:** Database migration rollback procedures with Docker Compose service restoration  
**Risk Mitigation:** Gradual feature rollout using environment-specific configuration flags  
**Monitoring:** Enhanced logging for authentication events with existing log aggregation patterns
