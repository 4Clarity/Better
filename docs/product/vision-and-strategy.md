# **Project Brief: Transition Intelligence Platform (TIP)**

## 1. **Problem Statement**
Government contract transitions are consistently high-risk, chaotic events characterized by significant knowledge loss, operational disruption, and high administrative overhead. The lack of a structured, intelligent process for transferring knowledge from outgoing to incoming contractors leads to extended ramp-up times, repeated mistakes, and a failure to preserve critical intellectual capital, ultimately impacting the continuity and resilience of government operations.

## 2. **Proposed Solution**
The Transition Intelligence Platform (TIP) is an AI-powered Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform designed to transform contract transitions into structured, data-driven, and auditable processes. TIP will ingest, analyze, and curate knowledge from a wide array of sources (e.g., code repositories, communication platforms, strategic documents) to create a centralized, context-aware knowledge base. Post-transition, the platform evolves into a "living knowledge system" for steady-state operations, ensuring long-term value and operational continuity.

## 3. **Key Objectives & Success Metrics**
The primary goal of TIP is to de-risk contract transitions and create a persistent, high-value knowledge asset.

*   **Reduce Transition Time:** Decrease the time to transition completion by 30%.
*   **Maximize Knowledge Retention:** Capture and verify at least 85% of critical operational knowledge.
*   **Accelerate Productivity:** Reduce incoming contractor time-to-productivity by 50%.
*   **Ensure Compliance:** Achieve 100% completion of contractual transition checklists.
*   **Improve User Satisfaction:** Attain a 4.5/5 satisfaction rating from all stakeholder groups.

## 4. **Target Users**
*   **Government Program Managers (PMs):** Who need a portfolio-level view of transition health, automated compliance tracking, and predictive risk alerts.
*   **Outgoing Contractor Leads:** Who need a clear, unambiguous process to fulfill their hand-off obligations and a verifiable record of their diligence.
*   **Incoming Contractor Teams:** Who need a secure, curated, and searchable knowledge base to accelerate their onboarding and become productive quickly.

## 5. **Scope Highlights**
*   **AI-Powered Knowledge Harvester:** Ingests and analyzes data from diverse sources including Git, ServiceNow, Teams, ADO, and strategic documents.
*   **Contextual Knowledge Filter:** Intelligently separates relevant information from project noise and routes intelligence across different projects.
*   **Actionable Resource Catalog:** Creates a verified toolkit of scripts, tools, and runbooks for the incoming team.
*   **Human-in-the-Loop Validation:** Workflows for outgoing contractors to verify AI-surfaced knowledge and for incoming teams to flag outdated information.
*   **Security-First Onboarding:** Integrates with security and badging processes to ensure access control is strictly enforced.
*   **Living Knowledge System:** Evolves post-transition to support ongoing operations, continuous onboarding, and troubleshooting.

## 6. **High-Level Roadmap Summary**
The project will be executed in a phased approach, beginning with foundational infrastructure and basic knowledge capture (Months 1-3), moving to AI enhancement and automation (Months 4-6), and progressively adding advanced orchestration, predictive capabilities, and finally evolving into a continuous, enterprise-scale living knowledge system (Year 2+).
