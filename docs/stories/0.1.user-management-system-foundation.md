5. Implement account lifecycle management (PENDING, ACTIVE, INACTIVE, SUSPENDED)
6. Create email verification and confirmation workflows
7. Build user management UI at `/security` route with search and filtering
8. Implement API service layer with proper error handling
9. Create comprehensive seed data with 6+ users across 4 organizations
10. Ensure all components follow established security patterns

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

This is the foundational story for the user management system, establishing the core infrastructure for government-compliant user lifecycle management.

### Data Models from Architecture

**User Management Core Entities** [Source: docs/log/development-log.md]:
- Person: Individual profiles with personal information, skills, and security clearances
- User: Account management with invitation workflows and status tracking
- PersonOrganizationAffiliations: Employment history and organizational relationships
- Roles/UserRoles: Hierarchical role-based access control system

**Government Compliance Features** [Source: docs/log/authentication-implementation-complete.md]:
- PIV card status tracking and management
- Security clearance level validation
- FISMA/FedRAMP compliance audit trails
- Account approval workflows with administrative oversight

### API Specifications

**User Management Service Pattern** [Source: docs/log/development-log.md]:
- RESTful API at `/api/user-management/*` with 15+ endpoints
- Complete CRUD operations for all user management entities
- Advanced search and filtering capabilities
- Type-safe API service layer with proper error handling

### File Locations

**Backend Services**: `backend-node/src/modules/user-management/`
**Database Schema**: Enhanced Prisma schema with user management models
**Frontend Components**: `frontend/src/components/user-management/`
**API Integration**: `frontend/src/services/userManagement.ts`
**Seed Data**: `backend-node/prisma/seeds/`

### Testing Requirements

**Testing Standards**:
- Unit tests for all backend services and models
- Component tests for React user management interfaces
- Integration tests for user invitation and approval workflows
- End-to-end tests for complete user lifecycle management

### Technical Constraints

**Government Compliance Requirements**:
- PIV card integration and status tracking
- Security clearance validation and expiration monitoring
- FISMA/FedRAMP audit trail compliance
- Role-based access control with granular permissions

**Security Requirements**:
- Secure token-based invitation system
- Account status validation and lifecycle management
- Comprehensive audit logging for compliance
- Integration with existing authentication patterns

## Testing

### Testing Standards

**Test Coverage**: Comprehensive testing across all user management components
**Testing Framework**: Vitest for backend, React Testing Library for frontend
**Integration Testing**: Complete user lifecycle workflows validated
**Security Testing**: Access control and permission validation tested
