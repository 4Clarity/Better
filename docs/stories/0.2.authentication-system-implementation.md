## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

This story resolves the critical authentication system blockers that were preventing production deployment, transforming the application from non-functional to enterprise-ready.

### Security Implementation Details

**Enterprise-Grade Security Features** [Source: docs/log/authentication-implementation-complete.md]:
- Multi-Factor Approach: Email verification + admin approval workflow
- Password Security: bcrypt 12-round hashing with strength requirements
- Token Security: 256-bit cryptographically secure tokens with expiration
- Session Management: Secure sessions with automatic refresh and fingerprinting
- Brute Force Protection: Rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms

**Access Control & Validation**:
- Role-Based Permissions: Granular role and permission system
- Input Validation: Comprehensive client and server-side validation
- SQL Injection Prevention: Prisma ORM with parameterized queries
- XSS Prevention: Input sanitization and security headers
- Audit Trail: Complete logging of all authentication events

### API Implementation

**Authentication API Architecture** [Source: docs/log/authentication-implementation-complete.md]:
```
Public Registration Endpoints:
- POST /api/auth/register              # User registration
- GET  /api/auth/verify-email          # Email verification
- GET  /api/auth/registration-status   # Check registration status
- POST /api/auth/resend-verification   # Resend verification email

Admin Management Endpoints:
- GET  /api/admin/pending-registrations  # List pending approvals
- GET  /api/admin/registration/:id       # Get registration details
- POST /api/admin/approve-registration/:id # Approve user
- POST /api/admin/reject-registration/:id  # Reject user
- POST /api/admin/bulk-action            # Bulk operations
- GET  /api/admin/statistics             # Registration analytics

Enhanced Authentication Endpoints:
- POST /api/auth/login                 # Enhanced login (Keycloak + password)
- POST /api/auth/authenticate          # Password authentication
- POST /api/auth/lookup                # User lookup by email
- POST /api/auth/refresh               # Token refresh
- POST /api/auth/logout                # Secure logout
```
