## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

This story implements a fundamental reorganization of the transition management system, providing the hierarchical structure needed for different types of organizational changes.

### Data Model Enhancement

**Three-Tier Hierarchy Schema** [Source: docs/log/implementation-summary.md]:
- **transitionLevel**: MAJOR | PERSONNEL | OPERATIONAL
- **transitionSource**: STRATEGIC | CONTRACTUAL | PERSONNEL | COMMUNICATION | CHANGE_REQUEST | ENHANCEMENT
- **impactScope**: enterprise | department | team | process
- **approvalLevel**: executive | management | operational
- **parentTransitionId**: Hierarchical relationships support

**Migration Strategy**:
- Existing transitions with contractId → Major Transitions
- Existing transitions with legacy contract fields → Personnel Transitions
- New transitions default to → Operational Changes

### Component Architecture

**Frontend Structure** [Source: docs/log/implementation-summary.md]:
```
src/components/transitions/
├── common/
│   ├── TransitionCard.tsx - Unified transition display
│   ├── TransitionFilters.tsx - Multi-level filtering
│   └── LevelIndicator.tsx - Visual level badges
├── major/
│   └── MajorTransitionDialog.tsx - Organization-level form
├── personnel/
│   └── PersonnelTransitionDialog.tsx - Team-level form
└── operational/
    └── OperationalChangeDialog.tsx - Process-level form
```

### API Implementation

**Enhanced Transition API Endpoints**:
- `GET /api/enhanced-transitions/counts` - Analytics for dashboard
- `POST /api/enhanced-transitions/major` - Create major transition
- `GET /api/enhanced-transitions/major` - Query major transitions
- `POST /api/enhanced-transitions/personnel` - Create personnel transition
- `GET /api/enhanced-transitions/personnel` - Query personnel transitions
- `POST /api/enhanced-transitions/operational` - Create operational change
- `GET /api/enhanced-transitions/operational` - Query operational changes

### File Locations

**Backend Services**: `backend-node/src/modules/transition/` (enhanced services)
**Database Migration**: `backend-node/prisma/migrations/` (three-tier hierarchy)
**Frontend Components**: `src/components/transitions/` (new component structure)
**API Routes**: `backend-node/src/routes/enhanced-transitions/`

### Testing Requirements

- Gradual migration without service interruption
- Rollback capability for all changes

**Performance Requirements**:
- Real-time transition counts for dashboard
- Efficient filtering across all transition levels
- Optimized queries for large datasets
- Responsive navigation across all device sizes

## Testing

### Testing Standards
