# Story KM.1.1: Database Schema Foundation

**Epic:** Knowledge Management - Database Schema and Backend Foundation
**Story ID:** KM.1.1
**Status:** Ready for Review
**Estimated Effort:** 2 days
**Priority:** High

## Story

As a **backend developer** implementing the Knowledge Management feature, I want to **design and implement a comprehensive Prisma schema for Document, Communication, Fact, Tag, Category, and KnowledgeSource models** so that **the Knowledge Management platform has a solid database foundation to support content ingestion, fact extraction, curation workflows, and semantic search capabilities**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Document Model Implementation**
   - Document table with fields for metadata, file storage, security classification, and processing status
   - Document table relationships to existing business-operation-schema-change.md and data-schema.md
   - Support for multiple file types (PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD, etc.)
   - Version control and parent-child relationships for document revisions
   - Integration with MinIO file storage paths
   - Security classification levels (Unclassified, Confidential, Secret, Top Secret)

2. **Communication Model Implementation**
   - Communication table for emails, chats, meeting transcripts, and other communications
   - Platform identification (Teams, Email, Slack, etc.)
   - Thread and conversation grouping capabilities
   - Participant tracking and metadata

3. **Fact Model Implementation**
   - Fact table for extracted knowledge pieces with structured content
   - Source document/communication references
   - Confidence scores and extraction metadata
   - Approval workflow status (pending, approved, rejected)
   - Categorization and tagging support

4. **Tag and Category Models**
   - Hierarchical category system for knowledge organization
   - Flexible tagging system with tag types and metadata
   - Many-to-many relationships with facts, documents, and communications

5. **KnowledgeSource Model**
   - Configuration table for external data sources (ServiceNow, ADO, Teams, etc.)
   - Connection parameters and authentication settings
   - Sync status and last update tracking
   - Data source type and capability definitions

6. **Database Migration and Indexes**
   - Prisma migration scripts for all new tables
   - Optimized indexes for search, filtering, and join operations
   - Foreign key constraints and referential integrity
   - Performance considerations for large datasets

## Dev Notes

### Source Tree Context
Based on project architecture (`docs/technical/specifications/information-architecture.md`):
- Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- Backend Location: `backend-node/`
- Schema File: `backend-node/prisma/schema.prisma`
- Migration Path: `backend-node/prisma/migrations/`

### Existing Schema Integration
Current schema includes extensive transition management models. New Knowledge Management models should:
- Follow existing naming conventions (snake_case for tables, camelCase for fields)
- Use consistent ID strategy (cuid() defaults)
- Follow established enum patterns
- Integrate with existing User and transition models where appropriate
- Maintain security patterns established in existing artifact models

### Database Standards (from CLAUDE.md)
- Never create files longer than 500 lines
- Use superuser accounts for DDL operations
- Validate foreign key references before operations
- Convert empty strings to null/undefined for optional foreign keys
- Regenerate Prisma client after schema changes
- Test migration scripts in development before production
- Seed new data tables with one test record

### Testing Requirements
Following project conventions:
- Create unit tests for new models
- Test at least: expected use, edge case, failure case
- Test location: `/tests` folder mirroring app structure
- Validate foreign key relationships
- Test schema validation rules
- Verify index performance with sample data

### Security Considerations
Knowledge Management requires enhanced security:
- PIV-based access control integration
- Document security classification enforcement
- Audit trail requirements for all knowledge operations
- Encrypted storage for sensitive configuration data
- Role-based access patterns following existing User/transition models

### Architecture References
- Information Architecture: `docs/technical/specifications/information-architecture.md`
- Knowledge Management Specification: `docs/technical/specifications/knowledge-management.md`
- Implementation Plan: `docs/work-in-progress/knowledge-management-implementation-plan.md`

### Performance Considerations
- Vector search preparation (pgvector extension readiness)
- Full-text search indexes for documents and communications
- Efficient join patterns for knowledge discovery queries
- Partition considerations for large fact tables
- Caching strategy for frequently accessed categories and tags

## Definition of Done
- [x] All models defined in Prisma schema following project conventions
- [x] Database migrations created and tested
- [x] Schema applied to development database successfully
- [x] Foreign key relationships validated
- [x] Indexes created for optimal query performance
- [x] Unit tests written and passing for all models
- [x] Prisma client regenerated and verified
- [x] Initial seed data created for testing
- [x] Documentation updated with new schema details
- [ ] Code review completed by senior backend developer
