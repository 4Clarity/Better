# Story KM.2.1: UI Foundation Integration

**Epic:** Knowledge Management - UI Foundation and Integration
**Story ID:** KM.2.1
**Status:** Done
**Estimated Effort:** 3 days
**Priority:** High

## Story

**As a** frontend developer implementing the Knowledge Management interface,
**I want** to integrate the Knowledge Management module into the main application layout and routing system,
**so that** users can navigate to and access the Knowledge Management features seamlessly within the existing TIP application structure.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Main Application Integration**
   - Knowledge Management section is integrated into the main application's navigation structure under "Operational Knowledge Platform"
   - Navigation follows the information architecture defined in `information-architecture.md`
   - Knowledge Management routes are properly configured and accessible
   - Role-based navigation shows/hides KM sections based on user permissions

2. **Routing Integration**
   - Knowledge Management routes are integrated with the existing React Router setup
   - All KM subsections have dedicated routes: Weekly Curation, Document Upload, Communication Files, Facts Curation, Approval Queue, Knowledge Search, Configuration
   - Breadcrumb navigation works correctly within KM sections
   - Deep linking to specific KM sections functions properly

3. **Layout Integration**
   - Knowledge Management uses the existing application layout and sidebar structure
   - KM sections render within the main content area alongside other TIP features
   - Responsive design maintains consistency with the rest of the application
   - Navigation state management integrates with existing application state

4. **Style System Integration**
   - All components use the established `shadcn/ui` component library
   - Styling follows the TIP style guide specifications (`style-guide.md`)
   - Color system, typography, and spacing match existing application standards
   - Dark/light theme compatibility if applicable

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
[Source: information-architecture.md#operational-knowledge-platform]
The Knowledge Management feature should be integrated under the "Operational Knowledge Platform" section with the following navigation structure:
```
├── Operational Knowledge Platform
│   ├── Living Knowledge Base
│   ├── Knowledge Curation Dashboard (This feature)
│   │   ├── Weekly Curation
│   │   ├── Product Documents
│   │   ├── Communication Files
│   │   ├── Facts Curation
│   │   ├── Approval Queue
│   │   ├── Knowledge Search
│   │   └── Configuration
```

### Frontend Architecture Requirements
[Source: frontend-spec.md#navigation]
- Uses persistent left-hand navigation bar that adapts based on user role
- Follows progressive disclosure principles - show users only what they need
- Role-based experience with tailored interfaces for different personas
- Clean, professional interface prioritizing content over decoration

### Component Architecture Standards
[Source: component-architecture.md#enhanceduserinterface]
- React 18 with TypeScript following existing component architecture
- Integration with existing component library and state management patterns
- Uses established Tailwind CSS configuration and component patterns
- Follows existing file structure and naming conventions

### Style Guide Requirements
[Source: style-guide.md]
- **Color System**: Primary `#0A58D0`, Neutral palette for text and backgrounds
- **Typography**: Public Sans font family, established type scale (H1: 36px, H2: 24px, etc.)
- **Spacing**: 8px grid system (xs: 4px, sm: 8px, md: 16px, lg: 24px, xl: 32px)
- **Components**: Standard border radius (8px cards, 4px buttons), consistent shadow system
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with 4.5:1 contrast ratios

### Technical Implementation Notes
[Source: knowledge-management.md#component-specifications]
- Main layout should integrate with existing application sidebar component
- Navigation items should be dynamically rendered based on user permissions
- Routing should use application's existing routing solution
- All UI components must be replaced with `shadcn/ui` equivalents

### File Structure and Locations
Based on existing project structure, KM components should be organized as:
```
frontend/src/components/knowledge-management/
├── layouts/
│   ├── KMLayout.tsx
│   └── KMNavigation.tsx
├── pages/
│   ├── WeeklyCuration.tsx
│   ├── DocumentUpload.tsx
│   ├── CommunicationFiles.tsx
│   ├── FactsCuration.tsx
│   ├── ApprovalQueue.tsx
│   ├── KnowledgeSearch.tsx
│   └── Configuration.tsx
└── components/
    └── [shared KM components]
```

### Previous Story Insights
- Database schema foundation (KM.1.1) established all necessary data models
- Backend API foundation (KM.1.2-1.4) completed all CRUD endpoints
- Frontend integration can proceed with confidence in backend stability

### Testing Requirements
[Source: CLAUDE.md#testing-and-reliability]
- Create tests first following TDD cycle
- Unit tests for new navigation components and routing logic
- Tests in `/tests` folder mirroring app structure
- Include: 1 expected use test, 1 edge case test, 1 failure case test
- Integration tests for role-based navigation
- Accessibility tests for WCAG compliance

### Security and Access Control
[Source: information-architecture.md#access-control-matrix]
- Navigation must respect role-based permissions
- Different user personas see different navigation options
- PIV status affects content visibility and access levels
- Progressive disclosure based on security clearance
