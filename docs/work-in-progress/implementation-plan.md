**Status:** Architecture Blueprint

---

## Executive Summary

This implementation plan outlines the comprehensive development roadmap for the Transition Intelligence Platform (TIP), transforming it from a basic transition tool into an enterprise-scale government knowledge management platform. The plan incorporates enhanced requirements including Government Program Director role, PIV exception handling, post-transition operational knowledge management, and multi-product portfolio oversight.

### Strategic Vision

TIP evolves through four distinct phases:

1. **Foundation Phase** - Secure multi-role platform with basic transition management
2. **Knowledge Platform** - AI-powered knowledge management with PIV security integration
3. **Enterprise Intelligence** - Advanced analytics, automation, and portfolio management
4. **AI-Driven Operations** - Predictive intelligence and continuous optimization

---

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Infrastructure

- **Backend**: Fastify/Node.js with TypeScript, basic Prisma schema (2 models)

- **Frontend**: React/Vite with shadcn/ui, minimal implementation

- **Database**: PostgreSQL with service account configured

- **Infrastructure**: Docker Compose with 9 services (DB, Redis, MinIO, Keycloak, etc.)

- **Security**: Service account created, basic RBAC foundation

### Gap Analysis

- **Schema Completeness**: Current 2 models vs required 21+ comprehensive entities

- **Role Coverage**: Basic PM/Contractor roles vs required 6 enterprise personas

- **Security Model**: Basic auth vs required PIV exception handling

- **Knowledge Management**: Missing AI/vector capabilities

- **Portfolio Management**: No multi-product oversight capabilities
