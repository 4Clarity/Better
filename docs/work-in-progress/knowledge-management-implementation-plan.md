## 1. Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for the Knowledge Management feature. It is based on the `knowledge-management.md` specification and is designed to provide a clear and actionable roadmap for the development team. The plan is broken down into epics and detailed tasks, covering the database schema, backend services, UI components, and LLM integration.

## 2. Epics and Task List

### Epic 1: Database Schema and Backend Foundation

**Goal:** To create the necessary database tables and foundational backend services to support the Knowledge Management feature.

| KM-DB-01 | Design and implement Prisma schema for `Document`, `Communication`, `Fact`, `Tag`, `Category`, and `KnowledgeSource` models. | High | 2 |
| KM-DB-02 | Create database migration scripts and apply them to the development database. | High | 1 |
| KM-API-01 | Create a new `knowledge` service in the backend to encapsulate all knowledge management business logic. | High | 1 |
| KM-API-02 | Develop API endpoints for CRUD operations on `Document`, `Communication`, `Fact`, `Tag`, and `Category` models. | High | 3 |
| KM-API-03 | Implement API endpoints for managing `KnowledgeSource` configurations. | Medium | 2 |
| KM-API-04 | Implement API endpoints for the `ApprovalQueue` (fetching items, approving, rejecting). | High | 2 |

### Epic 2: UI Foundation and Integration
