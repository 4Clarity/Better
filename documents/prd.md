# **Product Requirements Document (PRD): Transition Intelligence Platform (TIP) - MVP**

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Draft
**Author:** Product Manager
**Date:** 2025-08-16

## 1. Introduction & Problem Statement
Government contract transitions are fraught with risk, leading to significant knowledge loss and operational disruption. The lack of a centralized, structured process results in slow onboarding for new contractors and a high administrative burden for Program Managers. This PRD outlines the MVP for the Transition Intelligence Platform (TIP), a tool designed to solve this problem by providing the foundational infrastructure for structured, intelligence-driven transitions.

## 2. Goals & Objectives for the MVP (Phase 1)
The primary goal of the MVP is to establish the core functionality for knowledge capture and transition oversight.
- **Objective 1:** Create a centralized, auditable system for managing transition artifacts and timelines.
- **Objective 2:** Implement basic, automated knowledge ingestion from key sources to reduce manual effort.
- **Objective 3:** Provide a real-time, high-level view of transition status for Program Managers.
- **Objective 4:** Establish the foundational security and access control model.

## 3. Target User Personas
- **Brenda, The Government Program Manager:** Needs a single pane of glass to track compliance and status.
- **David, The Departing Contractor Lead:** Needs a clear checklist and a single place to upload required artifacts.
- **Maria, The Incoming Engineer:** Needs a centralized, searchable place to find initial onboarding documentation.

## 4. MVP Features & User Stories

### Epic 1: Transition Setup & Management

- **Feature 1.1: Contract Profile System**
    - **As a** Government PM (Brenda), **I want to** create a new transition project and define its core metadata (contract number, scope, key personnel), **so that** I can establish a centralized, authoritative workspace for the transition.
- **Feature 1.2: Transition Timeline Generator (Manual MVP)**
    - **As a** Government PM (Brenda), **I want to** create a transition plan with key milestones, tasks, and deadlines, **so that** all parties have a clear and shared understanding of the schedule.
- **Feature 1.3: Portfolio Status Dashboard (Manual MVP)**
    - **As a** Government PM (Brenda), **I want to** see a high-level dashboard of my active transition, with manually updated status indicators (e.g., On Track, At Risk), **so that** I can quickly assess its health and report to leadership.

### Epic 2: Core Knowledge & Compliance Capture

- **Feature 2.1: Artifact Vault**
    - **As a** Departing Contractor (David), **I want to** upload required documents and artifacts to a secure, centralized repository, **so that** I can fulfill my contractual obligations and have a clear record of submission.
    - **As a** Government PM (Brenda), **I want to** review submitted artifacts, approve or reject them with comments, **so that** I can ensure compliance and maintain a complete audit trail.
- **Feature 2.2: Onboarding Readiness Tracker**
    - **As a** Government PM (Brenda), **I want to** track the security clearance and badging status of incoming contractors, **so that** I can manage and control their access to sensitive project information.
- **Feature 2.3: Basic Documentation Harvester**
    - **As an** Administrator, **I want to** configure read-only connections to MS Teams and ServiceNow, **so that** the system can begin ingesting conversational and ticket data for future analysis.

### Epic 3: Initial Knowledge Access

- **Feature 3.1: AI Q&A Bot (Basic)**
    - **As an** Incoming Engineer (Maria), **I want to** ask questions in natural language and receive answers based on the existing, ingested documentation, **so that** I can find information independently and accelerate my onboarding.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
- **Security:** The platform must enforce strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Incoming contractors must not be able to access any data until their status in the `Onboarding Readiness Tracker` is "Cleared." All data must be encrypted at rest and in transit.
- **Auditability:** Every action (document upload, approval, status change) must be logged in an immutable audit trail.
- **Usability:** The interface must be intuitive, requiring minimal training for all user personas.

## 6. Success Metrics for MVP
- **Adoption:** 100% of new transitions are managed using TIP.
- **Compliance:** 100% of required transition artifacts are uploaded and tracked within the `Artifact Vault`.
- **User Feedback:** Achieve an initial user satisfaction score of >3.5/5 from early adopters.

## 7. Out of Scope for MVP
- Advanced AI features (predictive analytics, sentiment analysis, knowledge graph).
- Automated status synthesis and document generation.
- Deep integration with external tools beyond initial data ingestion.
- Cross-project intelligence routing.
