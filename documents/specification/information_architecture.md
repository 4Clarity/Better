## Executive Summary

This document defines the comprehensive information architecture for the Transition Intelligence Platform (TIP), an enterprise government knowledge management system. Originally designed for contract transitions, TIP has evolved into a comprehensive platform supporting multiple user personas, ongoing operational knowledge management, and enterprise-scale portfolio oversight through role-based navigation, progressive disclosure, and zero trust security principles while maintaining the "zero-training onboarding" goal.

### Key Architectural Principles
- **Enterprise Portfolio Management**: Multi-product oversight capabilities for Program Directors
- **Role-Based Experience**: Tailored interfaces for four primary personas plus specialized roles
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Information revealed based on user context, security clearance, and PIV status
- **Zero Trust Security**: Continuous verification with PIV exception handling and graduated access
- **Living Knowledge System**: Post-transition evolution into ongoing operational knowledge platform
- **Zero-Training Onboarding**: Intuitive navigation requiring minimal user instruction

### Enhanced User Personas
1. **Government Program Director** - Portfolio oversight, resource allocation, executive reporting
2. **Government Program Manager (Brenda)** - Project oversight, compliance, team management
3. **Departing Contractor Lead (David)** - Knowledge transfer, artifact submission, handoff
4. **Incoming Contractor Engineer (Maria)** - Knowledge acquisition, competency development
5. **Security Officers** - Access control, compliance monitoring, audit oversight
6. **Observers** - Read-only access for stakeholders and auditors

### Security Classifications & PIV Status Integration
- **PIV Card Holders**: Full access based on clearance level
- **PIV Exception**: Limited access to non-sensitive operational knowledge
- **Pending Clearance**: Restricted access pending security verification
- **No Clearance**: Public information only with audit trails
